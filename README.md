# AxonaForKiloSort

Scripts for converting .bin files from Axona recordings and: 
1) convert them into separate .bin files per channel (very slightly adapted from https://github.com/rutmic/read-raw-BIN)
2) convert the single channel .bin files to a combined .dat file for use with kilosort. Can combine signals from multiple separate bin files into one .dat file.
